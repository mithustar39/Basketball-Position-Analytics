### The Problem & Solution
**The Challenge:** Most amateur players train without a clear understanding of their natural strengths and weaknesses and where they fit on the court.

**The  Solution:** Pipeline that digests NBA performance trends (Points, Rebounds, Assists, True Shooting %, etc.). The system uses these data points to calculate a "Similarity Score" between the user and professional player profiles, outputting a data-backed training roadmap based on successful NBA patterns.
